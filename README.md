## üé® Icons

This project uses the [Nuxt Icon](https://nuxt.com/modules/icon) module with the [Hugeicons](https://icones.js.org/collection/hugeicons) collection for beautiful, consistent iconography.

### Usage

Use the `<Icon>` component with the `hugeicons:` prefix:

```vue
<template>
  <Icon name="hugeicons:apple-music" class="w-6 h-6" />
  <Icon name="hugeicons:piano" class="w-8 h-8 text-blue-500" />
  <Icon name="hugeicons:music-note-01" />
</template>
```

### Finding Icons

Browse and search for icons at [icones.js.org/collection/hugeicons](https://icones.js.org/collection/hugeicons). Simply copy the icon name and use it with the `hugeicons:` prefix.

### Styling

Icons inherit the current text color by default and can be styled with Tailwind CSS classes:

```vue
<Icon name="hugeicons:heart" class="w-5 h-5 text-red-500 hover:text-red-600" />
```
